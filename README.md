Homework 1:
To make the python run, you need to install the abstract base class module (abc). Run "pip install Lib". 
Simply just execute this Python code by running the following command: python HomeworkOne.py

Homework 2: 
Simply just execute this Java code by running the following command: java HomeworkTwo.java

If this does not work, we also have a project version of the Java already compiled in the HomeworkTwo directory. In that directory run "java Main" to run the already compiled Java.
